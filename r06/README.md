## Homework
### Due Tonight  

Please `git add` every file you change, `git commit`, and `git push`!!!

For homework, there are two problems.

For problem 1, you are to write your own assembly code in `prob1.s`
that multiplies the two arguments together. You are to do this without
the multiplication instruction - that is, you must implement multiplication
some other way.

For problem 2, you are to figure out what some assembly code (`prob2.s`) does,
and write C code that does the same thing in `prob2.c`.

You can test your work by running `make test` inside the homework directory.
