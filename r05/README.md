# Recitation Assignment 05


## In Class  

I will be debugging some code from lab2 in class.

## Homework
### Due Tonight  

Please `git add` every file you change, `git commit`, and `git push`!!!

You will debug the `delete` function in `main.c`. Do not touch any code besides the code
inside `delete`. A makefile is provided. 

Run make, and then run `./prob1`. 

Notice how an assertion fails. Think about what that assertion is checking, and what is wrong.
Fix the bug.
