## Homework
### Due Tonight  

In the for-homework directory, there is a program that finds the sum of
the numbers 1 to 10. However, a bug means that it currently doesn't work.

Tonight, you will fix [util.c](for-homework/util.c).
When you run `make`, it will produce
a program called `prob1`. Before you change anything, running `./prob1` will
loop forever and never give the right answer. You should fix util.c so that
it does give the correct answer after running `make` and `./prob1`.

You should use gdb to figure out why it does not work. Create a file called
README.md in the for-homework directory, and inside this file explain
how you used gdb to fix the program.

After it works please git add `util.c`, git commit it, and git push it.
