# Recitation Assignment 08

## Homework
### Optional  

For homework you are to change `prob1.c` in `for-homework` such that
it calls the `sadness` function.

To do this you may only change the two local variables inside `main`.

You should use `gdb` with `disass` or `objdump -d` to figure out
the correct values for these variables. 

If you are correct then two strings should print out instead of one.

Doing this will replace your lowest recitation grade.

Since today is Halloween I don't expect it to be done tonight,
so it is "due" by next recitation. There is no penalty for not doing
this homework.
