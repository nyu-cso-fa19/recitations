# Recitation Assignment 04  


## In Class  

Once again, I have some activities to do during recitation today. They are in the in-class directory.

You do not need to do anything to these files for homework.

## Homework
### Due Tonight  

Please `git add` every file you change, `git commit`, and `git push`!!!

You will be completing a program that counts the number of characters in all of its command line arguments, skipping the 0th argument.
It should return the sum of the lengths of the arguments after the 0th. For example, if I run `./prob1 abc de f`

Then there are four command line arguments. They are  
0: `./prob1`  
1: `abc`  
2: `de`  
3: `f`  

The result of running this command (`./prob1 abc de f`) should be `6`, because `abc` is three characters, `de` is 2, and `f` is 1, and `3+2+1` is 6.

You will complete `main.c` in the `for-homework` directory. You do not need to change any other files. A Makefile is provided for you.
You can test your code by running `make test`.
